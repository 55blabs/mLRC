Movie Recommender System

Introduction

This project implements a simple movie recommender system using collaborative filtering techniques. The system predicts user ratings for movies they haven't seen based on their previous ratings and the ratings of other users with similar tastes. We utilize the MovieLens dataset for demonstrating the recommendation process.
